## Aquatic Nature

The cube would contain layers of acrylic-shaped waves placed about halfway up the cube that would move up and down to imitate the movement of water in the sea. Under the waves, there would be various moving aquatic wildlife, such as fish, dolphins, and whales. The dolphins would occasionally jump out of the water above the waves and then back into the water. The seafloor would be at the bottom of the cube, containing rocks, seaweed, starfish, and sand. The goal of this project would be to highlight the aquatic part of nature, and the myriad of organisms that live there. The project will utilize sounds such as underwater and dolphin sounds, and possibly use lights.
