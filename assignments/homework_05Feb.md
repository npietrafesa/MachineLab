# Theme: Nature (Noah, Ehtisham, Aya, Evelyn)



## 1. Aquatic Nature

The cube would contain layers of acrylic-shaped waves placed about halfway up the cube that would move up and down to imitate the movement of water in the sea. Under the waves, there would be various moving aquatic wildlife, such as fish, dolphins, and whales. The dolphins would occasionally jump out of the water above the waves and then back into the water. The seafloor would be at the bottom of the cube, containing rocks, seaweed, starfish, and sand. The goal of this project would be to highlight the aquatic part of nature, and the myriad of organisms that live there. The project will utilize sounds such as underwater and dolphin sounds, and possibly use lights.

Here is a mockup of what the waves would look like. A video example can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDtjkKNOK8w)

### Materials:
- Wood (animals)
- Colored acrylic (waves)
- Steel (for gears possibly?)
- Paint (to color the seafloor and animals)
- Motors
- Lights (maybe)
- Speaker

## 2. Volcanic eruption - dormant cycle
When the volcano is sleeping, everything is calm and peaceful. Only the smoke is flowing. When the volcano is waking up-it erupts, the lava will come out from the crater. 
Animation: 
1) lava_1: up and down / Light up and turn down
2) Smoke: rotating
3) lava_2: Light up and turn down

Sound: rumble sound: using wood+machinery? 

Materials: 
1) Volcano: 3D printed
2) Lava: optical fiber
3) Smoke: cotton

Components: LED lights, motors


## 3. Birds, sun, and moon
At sunrise, tiny mechanical birds unfold their wings to a sweet tune. As the day goes on, the clock shows a choreography of gears, depicting the connection between daylight and the birdlife. When night falls, the birds find their nests, and the clock turns serene, with a moon-shaped dial softly lighting up, ticking away the hours until a new day begins with the rising sun.

Materials: Birds can be made using cardboards, nests from sticks and leaves. Sun and moon can be made using some hard paper with some transparency and they can have leds behind. 

## 4. Flower in Bloom
