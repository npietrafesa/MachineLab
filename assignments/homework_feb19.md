### Boat Base

Today we began work on the prototype of the boat swing, graduating from cardboard to actual wood. We started by grabbing scrap wood parts that could make up the base of the swing and started cutting it down to size. We used a plywood base and then used a long wooden beam that would serve as the part to hold up the boat and the servo. At each side and the back, more wood beams add stability along with two triangular plywood pieces. Essentially, we planned to attach one plywood triangle to the back and boat beams, and the other would be attached to the left, right, and boat beams in the front. We would start by attaching the wood pieces, then we would mount them to the base. To achieve this, we drilled holes in the wood and then screwed them together with an impact driver. I think we had a lot of issues with this part, because I wasn't really sure of the order in which to attach the parts together, and it was hard to keep the parts pinned down when drilling and screwing, mostly due to its size.

This would be a bigger problem when it came to attaching the bulky part to the base. It was pinned down as best I could, and it worked well enough. When it came to screwing to the base, I ran into more problems. I realized some of the screw spots I made the drill could not drill straight down, because the plywood pieces were blocking it. I ended up drilling there anyway because those parts were the closest to the boat beam and I wanted to ensure its stability. These were screwed in at a slight angle unfortunately, but the rest were drilled without relative issue. The screws at the towards the end had some trouble due to it being difficult to pin down, but it ended up being fine. Once all the wood was succesfully attached together, mounting the servo motor was next. As per disgression from our professor, we opted to use a more heavy-duty servo than from our previous iteration, since we don't want to worry about not having enough power or torque for our final boat. This was simple enough, as I screwed in two metal L brackets at the top of the boat beam, and screwed in the servo. The way it's mountain I am a little concerned about the support for the servo, since where the holes in the bracket are makes the servo sort of "float". Well have to see when we build the boat if it will prove to have too much stress on the bracket and cause it to slowly bend from the weight and momentum. This will be the next step in making our ride, making the boat itself and testing it. The servo also requires further testing, mostly about adjusting its rotation range, which I believe is currently at 300 degree range.
