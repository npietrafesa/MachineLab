## Themes

1. Nature and Technology: Inspired by Nam-June Paik's [TV Garden](https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/9537), I think it would be really interesting to have a clock that utilizes plants alongside an Arduino. Perhaps the clock can utilize the plants in some way, or have timed watering or something like that.
2. Time Zones: I think an interesting idea would be to explore the idea of different time zones all over the world. While it may be day time in the UAE, it could be evening or night in another country. Making parts that represent the time of day of other countries could be interesting, having a true world clock.
3. Music: I love music, so I will always be interested in implementing music into a project in some kind of way. Perhaps we could use the Arduinos to create user-interactive musical modules, or ones that could play at certain times of day, similar to church bells ringing at certain times of the day. Having a clock where the minute and hour hands are the black and white piano keys sounds interesting to me.

## Research Topics

1. Encoders are modules that can be attached to things such as motors to track its relative position. Encoders can be very useful if motors need to move a certain amount, or to measure things. I used to use encoders to track the distance in inches a robot would move, to have very accurate movements autonomously. [](https://www.encoder.com/motor-encoders)
2. Nixie Tubes are a type of glass tube that contain meshes inside, usually numbers. They were invented in 1955 by David Hagelbarger. Nixie tubes were commonly used to make early digital clocks or as counters. While I am not sure about the feasibility of acquiring or using these, I find nixie tube clocks to be really cool looking, and have a very nice vintage feel.

3. Bandsaws are a type of vertical power saw used primarily to cut wood. They are essentially larger versions of jigsaws, which is a vertical saw that constantly moves up and down to cut things. Bandsaws are very useful for cutting wood into shapes, and will probably be an important tool to use considering we will be working with wood to make parts of our clock (assuming it is like the prevous clock.)

4. Nam-June Paik was a Korean artist known as the father of video art. He often created physical works using TVs, such as making a humanoid person out of TVs, or putting it over the shape of the USA. I find his work very inspiring and could be a inspiration if we want to use a medium involving electronics in some way. [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nam_June_Paik)
5. Soldering is a process similar to welding as in it aims to combine metals together. It does this by melting and fusing metals together with a filler metal called solder. Soldering is often used to connect electronic modules to a circuit board, creating a strong bond that can also conduct electricity.
